# centro-app

These are the files containing the core scripts from a flask app built for my software development course at SUNY Oswego. I wrote the back-end and implemented the graph.js and javascript in the html that actually displays the historical information (bar graph). I also made some minor edits in the HTML/Inline CSS to improve site responsiveness.  

The back-end gathers data from the SQL database, calculates bus arrival accuracy, and presents that data on the front end. SQL database was populated by a Golang script not built by our team for time reasons.
